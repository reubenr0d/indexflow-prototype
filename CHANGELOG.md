# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [docs/INVESTOR_FLOW.md](docs/INVESTOR_FLOW.md): investor-oriented flow for basket shares, mint/redeem vs NAV, perp allocation, and operational dependencies; README **Documentation** links and a **NatSpec coverage** table for first-party 0.8.x contracts.
- Web app: SVG favicon (`icon.svg`) and matching inline header logo — white triangle on a black circle.
- `VaultAccounting.getVaultPnL` aggregate **unrealised** mark-to-market PnL per basket vault (sum of GMX `getPositionDelta` over open legs; GMX USD precision; price PnL only, not funding), with per-vault `_openPositionKeys` enumeration. In-place upgrades need a backfill of that list for already-open legs (or redeploy).
- Unit tests for aggregate unrealised PnL (`test/VaultAccounting.t.sol`) and integration checks vs GMX deltas (`test/Integration.t.sol`, `test/VaultAccountingIntegration.t.sol`).
- README **Operations** section: PriceSync vs OracleAdapter, keeper setup, Chainlink vs custom relayer price flow, and funding keeper calls.
- Web app: liquidity-aware indicative quotes from `PricingEngine` on Admin → Position Management (open form) and on Live Prices when a USDC notional is entered; uses GMX USDC `poolAmount` as liquidity input (GMX fills may still differ).
- Integration test suite (`test/VaultAccountingIntegration.t.sol`) covering VaultAccounting `openPosition` / `closePosition` against the real GMX Vault: long profitable, long loss, short profitable, and full deposit→open→close→withdraw pipeline with PnL verification.
- Initial changelog and Cursor rule for maintaining this file.
- Per-vault risk limits in VaultAccounting: `maxOpenInterest` and `maxPositionSize` caps with admin setters.
- Emergency pause mechanism (`setPaused`) on VaultAccounting; blocks `openPosition`, `closePosition`, `depositCapital`, and `withdrawCapital` when active.
- Optional `maxPerpAllocation` cap on BasketVault to limit capital sent to the perp pool.
- Events: `MaxOpenInterestSet`, `MaxPositionSizeSet`, `PauseToggled`.
- Risk-limits unit test suite (`test/RiskLimits.t.sol`) covering owner-gated setters, pause/unpause deposit/withdraw blocking, and BasketVault `maxPerpAllocation` enforcement.

### Removed

- Dead vendored GMX code: duplicate math libraries, unused OZ subtrees (ERC721, introspection, Strings, EnumerableMap/Set, vendored ERC20/Ownable), unused token implementations (WETH, Token), reference-only contracts (VaultPriceFeed, FastPriceFeed, FastPriceEvents), and ~20 unused interfaces for stripped modules (staking, AMM, governance, GLP, PositionRouter).
- Reader.sol functions for stripped features: `getTotalStaked`, `getStakingInfo`, `getVestingInfo`, `getPairInfo`.

### Changed

- Documentation: expanded NatSpec across first-party Solidity 0.8.x contracts and interfaces in `src/perp/` and `src/vault/` (external/public API, structs, and errors) for even coverage and easier auditing.
- `PerpReader.getTotalVaultValue` includes unrealised PnL from `getVaultPnL` so basket NAV is mark-to-market (previously realised only).
- Web app: MetaMask in the RainbowKit modal uses wagmi’s injected extension connector (`eth_requestAccounts` / `wallet_requestPermissions`) instead of the MetaMask SDK path, so the browser extension prompt reliably appears.
- CI: push runs only on `main`, `develop`, and `feature/**`; test job runs after build (`needs: build`); single `forge test -vvv` step; removed non-enforcing TODO/FIXME grep from lint.
